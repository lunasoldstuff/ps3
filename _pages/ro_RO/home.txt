## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Sony. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

In many cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free.

## What is Custom Firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do, in addition to anything homebrew can do. Essentially all homebrew solutions on the PS3 include a CFW of some kind.

## What does this guide install?

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified PS3 from stock firmware to custom firmware.

The best CFW solution currently available, REBUG, allows for convenient homebrew access on your device by running an exploit at boot-time to setup the homebrew environment.

## What can I do with Custom Firmware?



## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of PS3 hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ This guide will work on all PS3s (phat and slim).
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, PSN Account, saves, etc will be preserved).
