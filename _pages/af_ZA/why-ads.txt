This project is an extension of hundreds upon hundreds of hours of constant work.

We maintain this guide, for free, and ensure it is always up to date. Because of this effort, we feel that it is fair for us to attempt to gain a meager income from our work.

This site costs you nothing to use, and all that we display are non-intrusive ads. If you still have a problem with this, feel free to block these ads.

If you do block ads, we would like to also remind you of the [Donations](donations) page, but once again that is optional too.

Thanks,<br>
